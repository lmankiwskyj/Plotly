# Plotly
Module 12
Using Plotly, Javascript, and Bootstap I have created a dashboard to display:
 - Demographic information for each volunteer sample
 - The top 10 bacterial species in each volunteer sample
 - The number of bacteria species per sample
 - The volunteer washing frequency of their belly button
